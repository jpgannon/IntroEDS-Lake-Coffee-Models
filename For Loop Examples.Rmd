```

In order to do what we are going to do, we need "for" loops.

A for loop is a way to run a chunk of code several times while changing a value in that chunk of code each time.

We will use this to repeat a calculation again and again while advancing through time.

In R, the syntax for this is

> for(x in sequence){\
> x\
> }\

Where x will change every time you go through the loop. The values x will have each time through the loop are those that are in "sequence" above. If you changed this to x in 1:3, x would have values of 1, 2, and 3 each time through. If you made it x in c(2,3,5) x would change to 2, then 3, and then 5 each time through the loop. You can make the sequence anything and x can have any name so "letter in c(a, b, c)" would have *letter* change to a, then b, then c each time through the loop.

The image below shows a short example of how a for loop works.

![for loop](images/for%20loop.png "for loop") Let's try some examples

```{r}
val <- 0

for(x in 1:10){
  val[x] <- x
}

val

days <- c("mon","tues","wednes")

for(x in 1:length(days)){
  days[x] <- paste0(days[x], "day")
}

days

gages <- c("123","ABC","001")

for(g in gages){
  print(g)
}

```

## Challenge: Write a for loop

Define a vector with values 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Create a for loop that steps through this vector and adds 1 to each value.

Yes, you can do this by just typing the name of the vector + 1, but that's not the point!

```{r}

```
